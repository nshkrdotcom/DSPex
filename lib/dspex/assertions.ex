  DSPy assertions for constraining and validating LM outputs.

  Assertions can be used to ensure outputs meet specific criteria,
  with options to retry or raise errors on failure.

  Migrated to Snakepit v0.4.3 API (execute_in_session).

  Note: Assertions with Elixir predicates require bidirectional tool support
  and are currently not fully implemented. Helper functions return :not_implemented.
  """

  @doc """
  Create an assertion that must be satisfied.

  Note: Currently not implemented as it requires Elixir predicate registration.
  Use DSPy's built-in assertions or implement custom validation in your module.
