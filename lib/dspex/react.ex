  High-level wrapper for ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) functionality.
  
  This module provides a simplified API for ReAct operations,
  combining reasoning with tool usage in an iterative loop.

      search_tool = DSPex.React.make_tool("search", "Search the web", &search/1)
      calc_tool = DSPex.React.make_tool("calculator", "Do math", &calculate/1)

        "What is the population of Tokyo multiplied by 2?",
        tools: [search_tool, calc_tool],
        max_iterations: 5
      )
