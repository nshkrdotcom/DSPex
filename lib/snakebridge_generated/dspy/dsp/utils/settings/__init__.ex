  @doc """
  A singleton class for DSPy configuration settings.

  Thread-safe global configuration.
  - 'configure' can be called by only one 'owner' thread (the first thread that calls it).
  - Other threads see the configured global values from 'main_thread_config'.
  - 'context' sets thread-local overrides. These overrides propagate to threads spawned
  inside that context block, when (and only when!) using a ParallelExecutor that copies overrides.

  1. Only one unique thread (which can be any thread!) can call dspy.configure.
  2. It affects a global state, visible to all. As a result, user threads work, but they shouldn't be
     mixed with concurrent changes to dspy.configure from the "main" thread.
     (TODO: In the future, add warnings: if there are near-in-time user-thread reads followed by .configure calls.)
  3. Any thread can use dspy.context. It propagates to child threads created with DSPy primitives: Parallel, asyncify, etc.

  Returns:
  - `Dspy.Dsp.Utils.Settings.Settings.t()`
