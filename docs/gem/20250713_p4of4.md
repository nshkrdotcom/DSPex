Excellent. We have now reached the final planned stage. Phase 4 builds upon the production-ready platform from Phase 3 to deliver enterprise-grade features that make `DSPex` a truly top-tier solution for building and managing sophisticated AI systems. This phase focuses on automation, advanced orchestration, and scaling.

## 6. Detailed Roadmap: Phase 4 - Enterprise-Ready Platform

**Objective:** To evolve `DSPex` from a powerful platform into an autonomous, enterprise-grade "AI Operating System." This involves automating the deployment lifecycle, orchestrating multiple models intelligently, and implementing advanced, self-optimizing algorithms.

### **Month 7: Advanced Orchestration & Model Management**

| Week | Epic | Key Tasks & Implementation Details | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 29** | **(4.1) The Model Registry** | **Based on `stage4_advanced_features.md`:**<br>• **`DSPex.ML.Model` Resource:** Implement the Ash resource for managing LLMs. It should store provider details, model names, API keys (using Ash's secret management), and performance characteristics (cost, latency, success rate).<br>• **`DSPex.ML.ProgramModel` Resource:** A join resource connecting `Programs` to `Models`, defining their relationship (e.g., primary, fallback).<br>• **Health Check Worker:** An Oban worker (`ModelHealthCheckWorker`) that periodically pings the model's API to update its status and latency metrics in the `Model` resource. | ✅ Can register multiple models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a local Ollama model) in the database via the `Model` resource.<br>✅ The health check worker correctly identifies and flags an unavailable model. |
| **Week 30** | **(4.2) The Model Router** | **Based on `stage4_advanced_features.md`:**<br>• **`DSPex.ML.ModelRouter`:** Implement the core routing logic. Given a program and its inputs, the router should select the best available `ProgramModel` based on its strategy.<br>• **Implement Routing Strategies:**<br>  - `:primary`: Always use the highest-priority model.<br>  - `:fallback`: Use if the primary fails.<br>  - `:cost_optimized`: Select the model with the lowest `cost_per_token` that meets a quality threshold.<br>  - `:latency_optimized`: Select the model with the lowest `average_latency_ms`.<br>• **Enhance `ExecutionEngine`:** Integrate the `ModelRouter` into the main execution flow to dynamically select the model for each call. | ✅ A program configured with both a primary (`GPT-4o`) and a fallback (`Claude 3.5`) will automatically use the fallback if the primary's health status is `:error`.<br>✅ A program configured for `:cost_optimized` routing correctly chooses a cheaper model for a simple task. |
| **Week 31** | **(4.3) Advanced Optimizers (MIPRO Bridge)** | **Based on the `Optimizers` gap analysis:**<br>• **`DSPex.Optimizers.MIPRO`:** Implement the native Elixir module for the MIPRO optimizer. **This module does not contain the optimization logic itself.**<br>• Its `compile` function will:<br>  1. Serialize the program, dataset, and `Variable.Space`.<br>  2. Send a single `:run_optimization` command to the Python bridge with `"optimizer": "MIPRO"`.<br>  3. Await the final, optimized program state from Python.<br>• **Enhance `dspy_bridge.py`:** Add the `run_optimization` command handler that invokes the full `dspy.MIPRO` teleprompter. | ✅ Can successfully run `DSPex.Optimizers.MIPRO.compile(program, trainset)` from Elixir.<br>✅ The optimization runs in the Python process, and the final optimized program state is correctly returned and saved to the Ash `Program` resource. |
| **Week 32** | **(4.4) Multi-Objective Optimization** | **Based on `stage4_advanced_features.md`:**<br>• **`MultiObjective` Optimizer:** Implement a native Elixir optimizer that balances competing objectives.<br>• **Enhance `Evaluation Harness`:** Allow the harness to accept multiple metric functions (e.g., `accuracy`, `latency`, `cost`).<br>• **Pareto Frontier:** The optimizer's result should not be a single best program, but a "Pareto frontier" of programs representing the best trade-offs (e.g., the most accurate program under 500ms, the cheapest program with >90% accuracy). | ✅ Running the `MultiObjective` optimizer produces a set of non-dominated program configurations.<br>✅ The user can inspect the Pareto frontier to choose the best program for their specific needs. |

### **Month 8: Deployment Automation & Experimentation**

| Week | Epic | Key Tasks & Implementation Details | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 33**| **(4.5) Deployment Pipeline Framework** | **Based on `stage4_advanced_features.md`:**<br>• **`DeploymentPipeline` Resource:** An Ash resource to define an automated deployment workflow (e.g., "when a program's accuracy on the dev set improves by 5%, trigger a canary deployment").<br>• **`Deployment` Resource:** An Ash resource to track a specific deployment event, moving through states like `:pending`, `:validating`, `:deploying`, `:deployed`, `:failed`, `:rolled_back`. | ✅ Can create a `DeploymentPipeline` in Ash that links a program to a set of validation rules and deployment actions. |
| **Week 34**| **(4.6) Canary Deployment Strategy** | • **`DeploymentWorker`:** An Oban worker that executes the steps in a `Deployment` record.<br>• **Traffic Splitting Logic:** Implement a simple traffic splitter (e.g., a GenServer or ETS table) that the `ModelRouter` consults. The `DeploymentWorker` will update this splitter.<br>• **Implement Canary Logic:** The worker gradually increases traffic to the new program version (e.g., 1% -> 10% -> 50% -> 100%). At each stage, it monitors performance metrics from the `Execution` records. If metrics degrade, it triggers an automatic rollback. | ✅ Triggering a `Deployment` for a program successfully executes a canary release, observable through metrics.<br>✅ Forcing a canary to fail (e.g., by introducing a bug) results in an automatic rollback to the previous stable version. |
| **Week 35**| **(4.7) Advanced Experimentation** | **Based on `Scientific Evaluation Framework`:**<br>• **`Experiment` Resource:** Enhance this resource to support A/B testing between two or more program versions.<br>• **`AnalyzeExperimentResults` Action:** Implement a manual action on the `Experiment` resource that performs statistical analysis (e.g., a t-test) on the performance metrics of the variants to determine if a change is statistically significant.<br>• **Hypothesis Tracking:** Add fields to the `Experiment` resource to formally state a hypothesis (e.g., "Using `ChainOfThought` will improve accuracy by 10% but increase latency by 20%"). | ✅ Can define and run an A/B test between two program versions.<br>✅ The `analyze_results` action correctly identifies the winning variant and calculates the statistical significance of the result. |
| **Week 36**| **(4.8) Final Polish & Documentation** | • **Write Advanced Guides:** Create documentation for the multi-model router, deployment automation, and experimentation features.<br>• **Create a Full Demo Application:** Build a small Phoenix application that uses `DSPex` to showcase the entire MLOps lifecycle from experimentation to automated deployment.<br>• **Final Performance Tuning:** Profile the entire system under load and address any remaining bottlenecks. | ✅ The demo application is fully functional and can be used for presentations.<br>✅ The entire test suite, including all new components, passes with 100% reliability.<br>✅ Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets. |

### Phase 4 Deliverables & Outcome

Upon completion of Phase 4, `ElixirML`/`DSPex` will be a feature-complete, enterprise-grade platform that stands at the cutting edge of MLOps.

*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  A multi-model orchestration system with intelligent, policy-based routing.
    2.  An automated CI/CD pipeline for ML programs, including canary deployments and automatic rollbacks.
    3.  A suite of advanced, native optimizers complemented by a strategic bridge to Python's best-in-class tools.
    4.  A rigorous experiment management framework for data-driven decision-making.

*   **Resulting State of the System:**
    *   **Autonomous:** The system can now automate significant parts of the MLOps lifecycle, from optimization to deployment and monitoring.
    *   **Intelligent:** The platform makes informed, data-driven decisions about which models to use and when to deploy new versions.
    *   **Enterprise-Grade:** With features like the model registry, deployment pipelines, and advanced experimentation, the platform is suitable for use in large-scale, mission-critical applications.
    *   **Vision Realized:** The project has fully realized the initial vision of a superior AI orchestration layer in Elixir, demonstrating a clear and compelling advantage over pure Python-based systems for production use cases.
