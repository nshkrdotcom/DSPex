# Technical Manual: Python Bridge Pooling

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-14

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the `DSPex` Python bridge pooling system. It details the architecture, design principles, implementation, configuration, and testing strategy for managing concurrent, isolated Python processes.

### 1.2. Overview of the Pooling System
The Python bridge is a critical component for integrating Elixir with the Python DSPy ecosystem. The initial single-process bridge design, while functional, presented significant limitations in scalability, concurrency, and state management, leading to test flakiness and production bottlenecks.

The pooling system, built on `NimblePool`, addresses these challenges by replacing the single Python process with a managed pool of `PoolWorker` processes. This architecture provides:

- **Scalability**: Handles a high volume of concurrent requests by distributing work across multiple Python runtimes.
- **Isolation**: Guarantees session-level isolation, preventing state pollution and program ID conflicts between different users or tasks.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reuses warm Python processes to minimize startup overhead and manage system resources effectively.
- **Reliability**: Implements health monitoring and automatic recovery for worker processes, ensuring system stability.

### 1.3. Target Audience
This manual is intended for:
- **Software Engineers** developing and maintaining the `DSPex` library.
- **Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)** deploying and monitoring the system in production.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers** designing and executing tests for the system.

## 2. Architecture and Design

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture

The pooling system is managed by a dedicated supervision tree, ensuring fault tolerance and proper lifecycle management. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the single bridge, abstracted via the `DSPex.Adapters.PythonPool` adapter.

### 2.2. Key Components

#### 2.2.1. `DSPex.PythonBridge.PoolSupervisor`
The entry point and top-level supervisor for the entire pooling system. It starts and manages the `SessionPool` and `PoolMonitor`, ensuring that the core components are always running.

#### 2.2.2. `DSPex.PythonBridge.SessionPool`
This `GenServer` is the heart of the pool management system. It leverages `NimblePool` to manage a dynamic set of `PoolWorker` processes. Its key responsibilities include:
- **Pool Lifecycle**: Starting, stopping, and supervising the `NimblePool` instance.
- **Session Management**: Tracking active sessions and their state.
- **Request Routing**: Checking out available workers for session-specific or anonymous operations.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensuring all workers and sessions are terminated cleanly.

#### 2.2.3. `DSPex.PythonBridge.PoolWorker`
An implementation of the `NimblePool` worker behaviour. Each `PoolWorker` process is responsible for a single, dedicated Python process.
- **Process Management**: Spawns and manages a `dspy_bridge.py` process in `pool-worker` mode.
- **Communication**: Manages the `Port` connection for message passing.
- **Session Affinity**: Can be temporarily "bound" to a session ID during checkout to maintain context for a series of related operations.
- **Health & State**: Tracks its own health status (`:initializing`, `:healthy`, `:unhealthy`) and statistics (requests handled, errors, etc.).

#### 2.2.4. `DSPex.Adapters.PythonPool`
The public-facing Elixir module that implements the `DSPex.Adapters.Adapter` behaviour. It provides a clean, session-aware API for creating and executing programs, abstracting away the complexities of pool management. It transparently handles session creation and command execution via the `SessionPool`.

#### 2.2.5. Python Bridge (`dspy_bridge.py`) Enhancements
The Python script is enhanced to support the pooling architecture:
- **`--mode pool-worker`**: A command-line argument that starts the script in a mode ready to be managed by a `PoolWorker`.
- **Session-Namespaced Programs**: When in pool-worker mode, the `DSPyBridge` class stores programs in a nested dictionary: `self.session_programs[session_id][program_id]`. This is the core mechanism for session isolation.
- **Session Cleanup**: The bridge includes a `cleanup_session` command to purge all data associated with a specific session when it ends.
- **Stateless Operation**: Each command from Elixir includes a `session_id`, making each call self-contained from the pool's perspective.

### 2.3. Session Management and Isolation
The pooling architecture guarantees isolation through a combination of Elixir-side and Python-side logic.

1.  **Session Creation**: A session is implicitly created in the `SessionPool` the first time a `session_id` is used.
2.  **Worker Checkout**: When a request for a specific `session_id` arrives, `SessionPool` checks out an available `PoolWorker`. `NimblePool` gives preference to a worker that last served the same session (**session affinity**), but any available worker can be used.
3.  **Command Execution**: The `session_id` is passed with every command to the Python worker. The Python script uses this `session_id` as the primary key for its program registry, ensuring that `program_id`s from different sessions do not conflict.
4.  **Worker Check-in**: After the operation completes, the worker is checked back into the pool, ready to serve another request from any session.
5.  **Session Termination**: When `SessionPool.end_session/1` is called, the pool broadcasts a cleanup command to any worker that might hold state for that session, ensuring resources are freed on the Python side.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Elixir Implementation
The core of the Elixir implementation lies in the `PoolWorker` and `SessionPool` modules.

**`PoolWorker` Initialization (`init_worker/1`)**
The worker starts a Python process in the correct mode and performs an initial "ping" to ensure readiness.

```elixir
# in lib/dspex/python_bridge/pool_worker.ex
@impl NimblePool
def init_worker(pool_state) do
  worker_id = generate_worker_id()
  
  # ... validate environment ...
  
  # Start Python process in pool-worker mode
  port_opts = [
    :binary,
    :exit_status,
    {:packet, 4},
    {:args, [script_path, "--mode", "pool-worker", "--worker-id", worker_id]}
  ]
  port = Port.open({:spawn_executable, python_path}, port_opts)
  
  # ... initialize worker state ...

  # Send initialization ping to ensure the python process is ready
  case send_initialization_ping(worker_state) do
    {:ok, updated_state} ->
      Logger.info("Pool worker #{worker_id} started successfully")
      {:ok, updated_state, pool_state}
    {:error, reason} ->
      # ... handle error ...
  end
end
```

**`SessionPool` Execution (`execute_in_session/4`)**
This function demonstrates the checkout-execute-checkin pattern using `NimblePool`.

```elixir
# in lib/dspex/python_bridge/session_pool.ex
def execute_in_session(session_id, command, args, opts \\ []) do
  pool_timeout = Keyword.get(opts, :pool_timeout, @default_checkout_timeout)
  
  # ... track session ...

  # Execute with NimblePool
  try do
    NimblePool.checkout!(
      state.pool_name,
      {:session, session_id}, # Checkout with session context for affinity
      fn _from, worker_state ->
        # This block runs in the checked-out worker process
        case PoolWorker.send_command(worker_state, command, args, operation_timeout) do
          # ... handle response ...
        end
      end,
      pool_timeout
    )
  catch
    # ... handle timeout and other errors ...
  end
end
```

### 3.2. Python (`dspy_bridge.py`) Implementation
The Python script is designed to be stateless from the perspective of a single request, receiving all necessary context in the command arguments.

**Command Handling with Session Awareness**

```python
# in priv/python/dspy_bridge.py
class DSPyBridge:
    def __init__(self, mode="standalone", worker_id=None):
        self.mode = mode
        self.worker_id = worker_id
        # In standalone mode, programs are stored globally
        self.programs: Dict[str, Any] = {}
        # In pool-worker mode, programs are namespaced by session
        self.session_programs: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
        # ... other initializations

    def create_program(self, args: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        program_id = args.get('id')
        
        # Handle session-based storage in pool-worker mode
        if self.mode == "pool-worker":
            session_id = args.get('session_id')
            if not session_id:
                raise ValueError("session_id is required in pool-worker mode")
            
            # Initialize session if needed
            if session_id not in self.session_programs:
                self.session_programs[session_id] = {}
            
            program_registry = self.session_programs[session_id]
        else:
            program_registry = self.programs

        if program_id in program_registry:
            raise ValueError(f"Program with ID '{program_id}' already exists.")

        # ... create program and store it in program_registry ...
```

## 4. Configuration
The pooling system is highly configurable via `config/config.exs` or environment-specific files.

### 4.1. Enabling Pooling
To enable the pooling architecture, set the `:python_bridge_pool_mode` configuration flag. This is typically done in your environment configs (e.g., `prod.exs`).

```elixir
# In config/prod.exs
import Config

# Enable pool mode for the Python bridge
config :dspex, :python_bridge_pool_mode, true
```

### 4.2. Core Pool Settings
The primary configuration is for the `PoolSupervisor`.

```elixir
# in config/pool_config.exs or your environment config
config :dspex, DSPex.PythonBridge.PoolSupervisor,
  # Number of Python worker processes
  pool_size: System.schedulers_online() * 2,
  
  # Maximum additional workers created under load
  max_overflow: System.schedulers_online(),
  
  # Max time to wait for a worker (ms)
  checkout_timeout: 5_000,
  
  # How often to perform health checks (ms)
  health_check_interval: 30_000,
  
  # Whether to start workers lazily on first use
  lazy: false
```

### 4.3. Environment-Specific Tuning
The system is designed for different configurations per environment.

```elixir
# In config/dev.exs
config :dspex, DSPex.PythonBridge.PoolSupervisor,
  pool_size: 2,
  lazy: true

# In config/test.exs
config :dspex, DSPex.PythonBridge.PoolSupervisor,
  pool_size: 4,
  checkout_timeout: 10_000

# In config/prod.exs
config :dspex, DSPex.PythonBridge.PoolSupervisor,
  pool_size: System.schedulers_online() * 3,
  lazy: false
```

## 5. Testing Strategy

The pooling implementation is thoroughly tested across our **Three-Tier Testing Architecture**.

### 5.1. The Three-Tier Testing Architecture

Our testing philosophy is layered to provide a balance between speed and confidence:

-   **Layer 1: Fast Unit Tests (`mix test.fast`)**
    -   **Scope**: Pure Elixir logic, isolated modules.
    -   **Mocks**: All external dependencies (like Python processes) are mocked.
    -   **Speed**: Milliseconds.
    -   **Goal**: Rapid feedback for developers during TDD.

-   **Layer 2: Protocol Validation (`mix test.protocol`)**
    -   **Scope**: Communication protocol between Elixir and Python.
    -   **Mocks**: A mock server (`BridgeMockServer`) simulates the Python side, validating the wire protocol without requiring a full Python/DSPy environment.
    -   **Speed**: Sub-second.
    -   **Goal**: Ensure data serialization and command handling are correct.

-   **Layer 3: Full Integration (`mix test.integration`)**
    -   **Scope**: The complete end-to-end system.
    -   **Mocks**: No mocks. Uses real Python processes, a real DSPy installation, and can make real calls to LLM APIs (if configured).
    -   **Speed**: Seconds per test.
    -   **Goal**: Verify the entire system works together as expected.

### 5.2. How Pooling Factors In

Pooling tests are designed to cover all three layers:

-   **Layer 1 (Unit Tests)**:
    -   `PoolWorkerUnitTest` and `SessionPoolMockTest` test the internal logic of the components in isolation.
    -   The Python process is mocked using `DSPex.Test.MockPort` or by using the test process PID itself, allowing for fast, deterministic testing of state transitions and logic without any I/O.

    ```elixir
    # in test/dspex/python_bridge/pool_worker_unit_test.exs
    test "session checkout binds to session", %{worker: worker} do
      checkout_type = {:session, "user_123"}
      from = {self(), make_ref()}
      
      # Simulates the NimblePool checkout callback
      {:ok, _, updated_state, _} = PoolWorkerHelpers.simulate_checkout(
        checkout_type, from, worker, %{}
      )
      
      assert updated_state.current_session == "user_123"
      assert updated_state.stats.checkouts == 1
    end
    ```

-   **Layer 2 (Protocol Tests)**:
    -   Tests for the `PythonPool` adapter would use the `BridgeMock` adapter to ensure that session information is correctly serialized and passed according to the wire protocol. This confirms the pooling layer correctly communicates session context.

-   **Layer 3 (Integration Tests)**:
    -   `PoolWorkerIntegrationTest` starts a real Python process for a worker and verifies the full lifecycle.
    -   `SessionPoolTest` and `SessionPoolConcurrencyTest` start a full `NimblePool` of real Python workers to test session management, concurrency, and isolation under load.

    ```elixir
    # in test/dspex/python_bridge/session_pool_test.exs
    @moduletag :layer_3
    test "handles concurrent sessions without interference", %{pool: pool} do
      sessions = for i <- 1..10, do: "concurrent_#{i}"
      
      tasks = Enum.map(sessions, fn session_id ->
        Task.async(fn ->
          # Each session creates and executes its own program
          # The pooling system ensures these run in parallel on different workers
          # without interfering with each other.
          {:ok, program_id} = SessionPool.execute_in_session(
            pool, session_id, :create_program, %{id: "prog_#{session_id}"}
          )
          # ...
        end)
      end)
      
      results = Task.await_many(tasks, 30_000)
      assert Enum.all?(results, &(&1 == :ok))
    end
    ```

### 5.3. Advanced Testing: Chaos and Stress
The `pool_tests.yml.disabled` workflow file outlines a strategy for advanced testing to ensure production readiness:

-   **Stress Tests**: Run nightly to simulate high-load conditions over extended periods, testing the pool's stability and overflow handling.
-   **Chaos Tests**: Inject faults into the system, such as randomly killing `PoolWorker` processes, to verify that the `PoolSupervisor` correctly recovers and maintains system health.

### 5.4. CI/CD Strategy
The CI/CD pipeline is configured to run tests based on the layer, providing fast feedback for most changes while ensuring full system validation before merging to `main`.

-   **On Pull Request**: Run Layer 1 and Layer 2 tests.
-   **On Merge to `develop`/`main`**: Run all three layers.
-   **Nightly**: Run Layer 3 tests plus Stress and Chaos tests.

## 6. Usage and Operations

### 6.1. Basic Usage
The `PythonPool` adapter abstracts away the complexity. Developers interact with a session-aware API.

```elixir
# 1. Create a session-bound adapter instance
adapter = DSPex.Adapters.PythonPool.session_adapter("user_123_session_abc")

# 2. Use the adapter to create and execute programs
config = %{id: "my_program", signature: MySignature}
{:ok, program_id} = adapter.create_program(config)

inputs = %{question: "What is Elixir?"}
{:ok, result} = adapter.execute_program(program_id, inputs, %{})

# The session is automatically managed by the adapter and pool.
# No need to manually end the session unless resources need immediate cleanup.
DSPex.Adapters.PythonPool.end_session("user_123_session_abc")
```

### 6.2. Monitoring and Telemetry
The pooling system emits telemetry events for key operations, which can be hooked into for monitoring and logging.

**Available Events**:
- `[:dspex, :python_bridge, :pool, :checkout]`
- `[:dspex, :python_bridge, :pool, :checkin]`
- `[:dspex, :python_bridge, :pool, :worker_restarted]`
- `[:dspex, :python_bridge, :pool, :timeout]`

The `PoolMonitor` continuously checks the health of the workers and the overall pool, exposing metrics like:
- `active_sessions`
- `pool_size` & `utilization`
- `healthy_workers` & `unhealthy_workers`
- `total_commands` & `total_errors`

### 6.3. Troubleshooting

-   **`"Pool timeout - all workers busy"`**: The pool is saturated. Increase `pool_size` or `max_overflow`, or investigate long-running Python operations.
-   **`"Session not found"`**: Ensure the `session_id` is consistent across calls and that the session has not been explicitly ended or timed out.
-   **Frequent Worker Restarts**: Check the logs for `PoolWorker` errors. This often points to issues in the Python environment (e.g., package incompatibilities, memory leaks in the Python script). Use `PoolSupervisor.get_stats()` to monitor restart counts.

---

## 7. Conclusion
The `NimblePool`-based architecture provides a robust, scalable, and reliable foundation for integrating Elixir with Python DSPy. It solves the critical challenges of concurrency and state isolation posed by the single-process model. By leveraging a layered testing strategy and providing comprehensive configuration and monitoring capabilities, the pooling system is designed for both high-performance development and production-grade stability.
