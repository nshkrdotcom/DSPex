- "Unified Variable Spaces for Compositional AI: Breaking the Module Optimization Silo"
- "SIMBA-GV: Adaptive Optimization of Shared Parameters Across Heterogeneous LM Modules"
- "From Local to Global: A Variable-Centric Approach to LM Program Optimization"

### Abstract (rough ideas)
- Current LM programming frameworks (DSPy) treat modules as isolated optimization units
- We introduce generalized variables - parameters that transcend module boundaries

- SIMBA adaptation for variable geometry understanding
- Results show 23-47% improvement in multi-module programs (need to run experiments)
- Opens new research directions in compositional AI optimization

### 1. Introduction

**Hook**: "What if temperature wasn't just a parameter for one module, but a shared characteristic that influences reasoning style across an entire AI system?"

**Problem Statement**:
- LM programming emerging as dominant paradigm (cite DSPy, LMQL, Guidance)
- Current limitation: modules optimize in isolation
- Real systems need shared characteristics (formality, verbosity, reasoning depth)
- Example: medical diagnosis system where "conservativeness" should affect all modules

**Key Insight**:
- Variables in programs aren't module-specific, they're system characteristics
- Think: CPU temperature affects all cores, not just one
- Need unified optimization space

**Contributions**:
1. Formalization of generalized variables for LM programs
2. Variable-aware execution tracing and attribution
3. Cross-module gradient estimation techniques
4. SIMBA-GV: adapted optimizer for variable geometry
5. Implementation in DSPex proving feasibility
6. Empirical validation on 5 benchmark tasks

### 2. Background and Related Work

#### 2.1 LM Programming Frameworks
- DSPy and the module abstraction (Khattab et al.)
- Compositional approaches (Chain of Thought, ReAct, etc.)
- Current optimization methods (BootstrapFewShot, MIPRO)
- **Gap**: all assume module-local parameter spaces

#### 2.2 Parameter Sharing in ML
- Multi-task learning parameter sharing
- Neural architecture search shared weights
- Hyperparameter optimization across models
- **Difference**: we're sharing semantic/behavioral parameters, not weights

#### 2.3 Program Synthesis and Optimization
- Traditional program optimization (loop unrolling, etc.)
- Differentiable programming
- Black-box optimization
- **Our approach**: gray-box with semantic understanding

### 3. Generalized Variables: Formalization

#### 3.1 Definitions

**Definition 1 (Generalized Variable)**: A generalized variable v ∈ V is a tuple (τ, D, C, σ) where:
- τ is the type (continuous, discrete, module-type)
- D is the domain
- C is the constraint set
- σ is the semantic binding function

**Definition 2 (Variable-Aware Module)**: A module M is variable-aware if it implements:
- get_variables(): → Set[Variable]
- apply_variables(V): → M'
- get_feedback(execution): → Gradient[V]

**Definition 3 (Cross-Module Program)**: A program P = (M₁, M₂, ..., Mₙ, V, φ) where:
- Mᵢ are variable-aware modules
- V is shared variable set
- φ is the composition function

#### 3.2 Variable Types

1. **Continuous Behavioral Variables**
   - Temperature (creativity vs consistency)
   - Verbosity (concise vs detailed)
   - Formality (casual vs academic)

2. **Discrete Structural Variables**
   - Reasoning strategy (step-by-step vs holistic)
   - Output format (JSON vs prose)
   - Error handling (strict vs lenient)

3. **Module-Type Variables** (novel contribution)
   - Variable that changes module behavior class
   - Example: AuthorStyle variable that makes all modules write like specific authors
   - Requires new theory for optimization

### 4. Variable-Aware Execution Framework

#### 4.1 Execution Traces with Variable Attribution

**Key Innovation**: Traces that track not just what happened, but which variables influenced each decision

```
Trace = {
  module_calls: [(module_id, timestamp, input, output)],
  variable_uses: [(var_id, timestamp, context, influence_score)],
  decision_points: [(decision_type, chosen, alternatives, variable_weights)]
}
```

#### 4.2 Cross-Module Variable Impact Measurement

**Challenge**: How do we measure impact of temperature on both Predict and ChainOfThought?

**Solution**: Unified effect metrics
- Semantic drift measurement
- Output distribution analysis
- Consistency scoring across modules

#### 4.3 Gradient Estimation for Black-Box LMs

Since we can't backprop through LMs, we need:
- Finite difference methods
- Semantic gradient approximation
- Natural language feedback incorporation (!)

### 5. SIMBA-GV: Geometry-Aware Variable Optimization

#### 5.1 Variable Space Geometry

**Insight**: Variable space has special structure
- Some variables are correlated (temperature ↔ creativity)
- Some are antagonistic (speed ↔ accuracy)
- Some have module-specific effects

#### 5.2 Adaptive Sampling in Variable Space

Original SIMBA samples data points. SIMBA-GV samples variable configurations:

1. **Coverage-based sampling**: Ensure we explore variable space
2. **Gradient-informed sampling**: Sample more in high-gradient regions
3. **Constraint-aware sampling**: Respect variable constraints

#### 5.3 Intelligent Mutation Strategies

**Key idea**: Mutations should understand variable semantics

- Temperature mutations: small changes, affects all modules
- Style mutations: discrete jumps, coordinated across modules
- Structural mutations: large changes, may need re-initialization

#### 5.4 Cross-Module Bootstrap

**Novel**: Bootstrap examples that work well for ALL modules sharing a variable

Algorithm:
1. Generate candidate examples
2. Evaluate on each module with shared variables
3. Score with multi-objective optimization
4. Select Pareto-optimal examples

### 6. Implementation: DSPex Architecture

#### 6.1 Native vs Python Execution

- Native: evaluation, tracing, variable management
- Python: DSPy modules via Snakepit
- Hybrid execution model

#### 6.2 Performance Considerations

- Variable application overhead
- Trace collection impact
- Optimization loop efficiency

#### 6.3 API Design

Show how users interact with system - should be intuitive!

### 7. Experimental Evaluation

#### 7.1 Benchmark Tasks

1. **Multi-Stage QA**: Question → Keywords → Search → Answer
   - Shared variable: search_depth
   
2. **Document Processing**: Parse → Extract → Summarize → Format
   - Shared variable: detail_level
   
3. **Code Generation**: Understand → Plan → Implement → Test

4. **Creative Writing**: Ideate → Outline → Write → Edit

5. **Scientific Analysis**: Hypothesize → Experiment → Analyze → Conclude
   - Shared variable: confidence_threshold

#### 7.2 Baselines

- DSPy with independent module optimization
- Naive parameter sharing (same value, no optimization)
- Grid search over variable space
- Random search baseline

#### 7.3 Metrics

- Task-specific performance (accuracy, F1, BLEU, etc.)
- Optimization efficiency (convergence rate)
- Variable stability across modules

RQ2: How does variable type affect optimization difficulty?
RQ3: What is the computational overhead of variable-aware execution?
