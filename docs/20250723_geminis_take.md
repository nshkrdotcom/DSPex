# Status of gRPC, Tool Bridge, and Variables Implementation

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Author**: AI Assistant
- **Version**: 1.0

## 1. Overall Status

The project has successfully implemented the foundational layers of the unified gRPC bridge, as outlined in the specifications. The core variable system (Stage 1) is nearly complete on both the Elixir and Python sides, providing a robust, type-safe, and versioned state management system. The bidirectional tool bridge (Stage 2) is partially implemented, with mechanisms for registration and discovery in place, but the core remote execution logic is incomplete. Real-time streaming features (Stage 3) are defined in the protocol but are not yet implemented in the server handlers.

The architecture is sound, with a clear separation of concerns between the stateful Elixir `SessionStore` and stateless Python workers, a comprehensive protobuf definition, and a rich Python `SessionContext` API. The remaining work focuses on activating the streaming capabilities and completing the tool execution dispatch logic.

## 2. Detailed Status by Feature

### 2.1. Variables System

The variable system is the most complete feature set, aligning closely with the Stage 1 and Stage 2 specifications.

#### ✅ **Complete**

-   **Elixir Core**:
    -   A comprehensive `Snakepit.Bridge.Variables.Variable` struct with versioning, metadata, and optimization status fields.
    -   A complete type system in `snakepit/lib/bridge/variables/types/` supporting `float`, `integer`, `string`, `boolean`, `choice`, `module`, `embedding`, and `tensor`. Each type includes validation and constraint checking.
    -   The `Snakepit.Bridge.SessionStore` is fully equipped with variable management logic, including CRUD operations, batch `get_variables`/`update_variables`, and an index for name-based lookups.
-   **Python Client**:
    -   The `snakepit_bridge.session_context.SessionContext` provides a rich, Pythonic API for all variable operations.
    -   Features intelligent caching with TTL, multiple access patterns (`__getitem__`, `.v` namespace), `VariableProxy` for lazy access, and a `batch_updates` context manager.
    -   A matching `snakepit_bridge.serialization.TypeSerializer` ensures cross-language type consistency.
-   **gRPC Protocol**:
    -   All necessary RPCs for variable CRUD and batch operations (`RegisterVariable`, `GetVariable`, `SetVariable`, `GetVariables`, etc.) are defined in `snakepit_bridge.proto` and implemented in the Elixir `BridgeServer`.

#### ❌ **To Do**

1.  **Implement `WatchVariables` Streaming**: The `WatchVariables` RPC is defined in the protocol but the handler in `snakepit/grpc/bridge_server.ex` raises an `:unimplemented` error. The corresponding Python client-side logic in `SessionContext` is also a placeholder. This is the primary missing piece for Stage 3 reactivity.
2.  **Implement Advanced Features (Stage 4)**: The protocol defines RPCs for dependencies, optimization, and history (`AddDependency`, `StartOptimization`, `GetVariableHistory`, `RollbackVariable`), but the underlying `SessionStore` logic and gRPC handlers are not yet implemented.

### 2.2. Tool Bridge

The tool bridge provides the mechanisms for bidirectional tool execution. The registration and discovery parts are complete, but the execution dispatch logic is a key missing piece.

#### ✅ **Complete**

-   **Elixir Core**:
    -   `Snakepit.Bridge.ToolRegistry` provides a robust `GenServer` for registering both local (Elixir) and remote (Python) tools, storing them with their associated `worker_id`.
    -   Logic for exposing Elixir tools to Python (`list_exposed_elixir_tools`) is in place.
-   **Python Client & Adapters**:
    -   The `snakepit_bridge.base_adapter.BaseAdapter` and `@tool` decorator provide a clean way for Python workers to define and register their tools.
    -   The `SessionContext` has implemented methods (`get_exposed_elixir_tools`, `call_elixir_tool`) for Python to discover and execute Elixir tools.
-   **gRPC Protocol**:
    -   RPCs for `RegisterTools`, `GetExposedElixirTools`, and `ExecuteElixirTool` are defined and fully implemented on the Elixir server, enabling the bidirectional flow.

#### ❌ **To Do**

1.  **Implement Remote Tool Dispatch**: The `ExecuteTool` handler in `snakepit/grpc/bridge_server.ex` currently only executes local Elixir tools. It needs to be extended to:
    -   Look up the tool in `ToolRegistry`.
    -   If the tool is `:remote`, identify the correct `worker_id`.
    -   Dispatch an `ExecuteTool` request to that specific Python worker's gRPC server. This requires the Elixir side to have a gRPC client connection to each worker.
2.  **Implement `ExecuteStreamingTool`**: The handler for streaming tools in `snakepit/grpc/bridge_server.ex` is a stub. This needs to be implemented to forward the request to the correct Python worker and then proxy the resulting stream back to the original Elixir caller.

---

### 2.3. gRPC Core & Streaming

The core infrastructure is solid, but the streaming capabilities are not yet activated on the server side.

#### ✅ **Complete**

-   **Protocol Definition**: The `snakepit_bridge.proto` file is comprehensive, using a `BridgeService` and defining messages for all planned stages.
-   **Client Implementation**: The Elixir gRPC client (`snakepit/lib/grpc/client_impl.ex`) has implemented functions for both unary and streaming RPCs.
-   **Server Foundation**: The Elixir `BridgeServer` and Python `grpc_server.py` are functional and handle unary requests correctly.
-   **Process Management**: The Elixir `GRPCWorker` reliably starts, monitors, and cleans up the Python gRPC server process.

#### ❌ **To Do**

1.  **Implement Server-Side Streaming Handlers**: This is the most significant remaining task.
    -   **`WatchVariables` in `BridgeServer`**: Implement the logic to subscribe to the `ObserverManager` (from Stage 3 specs) and push updates to the client stream.
    -   **`ExecuteStreamingTool` in `BridgeServer`**: Implement the logic to dispatch the call to the appropriate Python worker and proxy the stream of `ToolChunk` messages back.
    -   **`ExecuteStreamingTool` in Python `grpc_server.py`**: The Python gRPC handler needs to be able to handle a tool that returns a generator/iterator and stream the yielded chunks back to Elixir.

## 3. Work Remaining (Roadmap)

The following is a prioritized list of tasks to achieve full functionality for the unified bridge.

### **Priority 1: Complete Core Tool & Streaming Execution**

1.  **Implement Remote Tool Dispatch in `BridgeServer`**:
    -   Modify the `ExecuteTool` handler in `snakepit/grpc/bridge_server.ex`.
    -   Use `ToolRegistry.get_tool/2` to find the tool's `worker_id`.
    -   The `GRPCWorker` needs to manage a gRPC channel *to* its Python process, or a central dispatcher needs to manage connections to all workers.
    -   Forward the `ExecuteToolRequest` to the correct worker.

2.  **Implement `ExecuteStreamingTool` Handler (Elixir & Python)**:
    -   **Elixir `BridgeServer`**: Implement the `ExecuteStreamingTool` handler to forward the request to the Python worker (similar to the above) and proxy the stream response.
    -   **Python `grpc_server.py`**: Implement the `ExecuteStreamingTool` handler. It should call the adapter's tool, check if it returns a generator, and then yield `ToolChunk` messages for each item.

### **Priority 2: Enable Real-Time Variable Watching**

1.  **Implement ObserverManager**: Create the `ObserverManager` GenServer as specified in Stage 3 to decouple `SessionStore` from stream management.
2.  **Update `SessionStore`**: Integrate `ObserverManager.notify_observers` into the variable update logic.
3.  **Implement `WatchVariables` Handler**: Implement the `WatchVariables` gRPC handler in `BridgeServer`. It should subscribe the stream to the `ObserverManager` and push updates.
4.  **Implement Python Client Stream Consumption**: Finalize the `async for` implementation in `SessionContext.watch_variables` to consume the stream from Elixir.

### **Priority 3: Implement Advanced Stage 4 Features**

1.  **Dependencies**: Implement the `DependencyGraph` and integrate it into `SessionStore`. Add the `AddDependency` RPC handler.
2.  **Optimization**: Add `optimization_status` logic to `Variable` and `SessionStore`. Implement the `StartOptimization` and `StopOptimization` RPC handlers.
3.  **History & Versioning**: Extend the `Variable` struct and `SessionStore` to maintain a history of changes. Implement the `GetVariableHistory` and `RollbackVariable` RPC handlers.
