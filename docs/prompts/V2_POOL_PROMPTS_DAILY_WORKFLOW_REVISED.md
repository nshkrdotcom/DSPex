### Review Uncommitted Work
```
Let's check for any uncommitted work from last session.

2. If not set, determine from current work phase

Run appropriate tests:
1. For Phase 1-2: mix test test/dspex/python_bridge/
2. For Phase 3-4: TEST_MODE=full_integration mix test --only integration
3. For Phase 5: mix test --only monitoring
4. Check for any new failures

Show me:
1. Test command used
2. Summary of results
