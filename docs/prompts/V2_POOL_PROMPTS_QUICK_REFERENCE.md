```

## üîç Code Search Prompts

### Find Pattern
```
Find all instances of [pattern] in the codebase:

4. Look in test files too
5. Document findings
```

### Find Related Code
```
Find code related to [feature]:
1. Search for module names
2. Look for function calls

```

## üìù Documentation Prompts

### Update Documentation
```
Update documentation for [component]:
1. Update module @moduledoc
2. Add/update function @doc
3. Include examples
4. Update CLAUDE.md
5. Add to relevant guides
```

### Create Runbook
```
Create runbook for [scenario]:
1. Describe the scenario
2. List detection methods
3. Document steps to resolve
4. Include verification steps
5. Add to operations guide
```

## üö¢ Deployment Prompts

### Prepare Release
```
Prepare for release:
1. Run full test suite
2. Check code coverage
3. Run linter and formatter
4. Update version
5. Create release notes
```

### Validate Deployment
```
Validate deployment readiness:
1. All tests passing?
2. Performance targets met?
3. Documentation complete?
4. Rollback plan ready?
5. Monitoring configured?
```

## üí° Architecture Decisions

### Evaluate Options
```
Evaluate options for [decision]:
1. List all options
2. Compare pros/cons
3. Consider our design principles
4. Check performance impact
