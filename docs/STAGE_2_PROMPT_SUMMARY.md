# Stage 2: Native Implementation - Comprehensive Prompt Strategy

## Overview

After creating the detailed technical specification, it's clear that the original 12 prompts are insufficient to cover the complexity and scope of the native Elixir DSPy implementation. The technical specification reveals significantly more components and integration points than originally anticipated.

**Recommendation**: Expand to **16 comprehensive prompts** to properly handle all components with adequate detail and context.

## Revised Prompt Architecture

### Foundation Layer (Prompts 1-4)
**Core infrastructure and compilation systems**

### Execution Layer (Prompts 5-8) 
**Module systems, prediction pipelines, and reasoning patterns**

### Provider Layer (Prompts 9-12)
**External integrations, provider clients, and communication**

### Production Layer (Prompts 13-16)
**Performance, monitoring, deployment, and integration**
