**Objective:** Proactively identify and plan for challenges during the migration.

---

## Technical Risks

### 1. Circular Dependencies

**Risk Level:** High  
**Impact:** Build failures, runtime errors  
**Likelihood:** Very High

**Description:**  
During migration, modules in different layers may still reference each other, creating circular dependencies. For example, DSPex might reference SnakepitGRPCBridge while platform modules still import DSPex types.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Dependency Analysis Tool**
   ```bash
   # Create dependency graph before each stage
   mix xref graph --format dot
   dot -Tpng xref_graph.dot -o dependencies.png
   ```

2. **Interface Segregation**
   - Create thin interface modules that define shared types
   - Move shared types to a separate `snakepit_common` package
   - Use protocols instead of direct module dependencies

3. **Staged Migration**
   - Migrate leaves of dependency tree first
   - Use temporary shim modules during transition
   - Validate no circular deps after each component migration

### 2. Python/Elixir Serialization Incompatibilities

**Risk Level:** High  
**Impact:** Data corruption, runtime errors  
**Likelihood:** High

**Description:**  
Moving serialization code between layers may expose incompatibilities in how data is encoded/decoded between Elixir and Python, especially for complex types like tensors or custom structs.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Comprehensive Serialization Tests**
   ```elixir
   # Test all type combinations
   defmodule SerializationTest do
     @test_cases [
       {:string, "hello"},
       {:unicode, "hello ‰∏ñÁïå üåç"},
       {:float, 3.14159},
       {:large_int, 1_000_000_000_000},
       {:nested_map, %{a: %{b: %{c: "deep"}}}},
       {:binary, <<0, 1, 2, 3>>},
       {:tensor, %{shape: [2, 3], data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}}
     ]
     
     test "round trip all types" do
       for {type, value} <- @test_cases do
         assert {:ok, ^value} = roundtrip(value), "Failed for #{type}"
       end
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Versioned Serialization Protocol**
   - Add version markers to serialized data
   - Support multiple protocol versions during migration
   - Log warnings for deprecated formats

3. **Type Registry**
   - Central registry of supported types
   - Explicit type mappings between languages
   - Runtime type validation

### 3. Process Management Backend Compatibility

**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Impact:** Process orphans, resource leaks  
**Likelihood:** Medium

**Description:**  
The dual backend system (systemd/setsid) may behave differently in edge cases, such as signal handling, process group management, or resource limit enforcement.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Backend Behavior Tests**
   ```elixir
   # Ensure consistent behavior across backends
   defmodule BackendConsistencyTest do
     @backends [ProcessBackend.Systemd, ProcessBackend.Setsid]
     
     for backend <- @backends do
       @tag backend: backend
       test "signal handling for #{backend}" do
         # Test SIGTERM, SIGKILL, process groups
       end
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Detect backend capabilities at runtime
   - Disable features not supported by current backend
   - Clear user warnings about limitations

3. **Process Tracking Redundancy**
   - Multiple tracking mechanisms (PID files, DETS, process groups)
   - Periodic orphan scanning
   - Conservative cleanup (verify before killing)

### 4. gRPC Connection Management

**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Impact:** Connection leaks, performance degradation  
**Likelihood:** Medium

**Description:**  
Moving gRPC management to the platform layer requires careful handling of connection pooling, reconnection logic, and cleanup.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Connection Pool Implementation**
   ```elixir
   defmodule GRPCPool do
     use GenServer
     
     def init(config) do
       # Pool configuration
       pool_config = [
         size: config[:pool_size] || 10,
         max_overflow: config[:max_overflow] || 5,
         strategy: :fifo
       ]
       
       # Health check timer
       Process.send_after(self(), :health_check, 5000)
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Detect failing connections
   - Temporary disable broken connections
   - Automatic recovery attempts

3. **Connection Monitoring**
   - Track connection metrics
   - Alert on connection exhaustion
   - Automatic scaling based on load

### 2. Breaking Existing Functionality

**Risk Level:** High  
**Impact:** User disruption, support burden  
**Likelihood:** Medium

**Description:**  
Despite compatibility layers, subtle behavior changes could break existing user code.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   ```elixir
   # Run against both old and new implementation
   defmodule CompatibilityTest do
     @example_files Path.wildcard("examples/**/*.exs")
     
     for example <- @example_files do
       @tag example: example
       test "compatibility: #{example}" do
         assert {output_old, 0} = System.cmd("mix", ["run", example], env: [{"USE_OLD", "true"}])
         assert {output_new, 0} = System.cmd("mix", ["run", example], env: [{"USE_NEW", "true"}])
         assert output_old == output_new
       end
     end
   end
   ```
