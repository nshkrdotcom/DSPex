# DSPex V2 Foundation Specification

## Overview

This directory contains the complete specification for DSPex V2 Foundation phase - a ground-up reimplementation of DSPex using Snakepit as the core dependency for Python process management.

## Documents

### [01_requirements.md](01_requirements.md)
Comprehensive requirements specification covering:
- Functional requirements for core API, Python bridge, and native implementations
- Non-functional requirements for performance, reliability, and scalability
- Constraints and success criteria
- Risk analysis and future considerations

**Key Requirements:**
- Unified API hiding implementation details
- Smart routing between native and Python
- High-performance native implementations where appropriate
- Production-grade reliability and monitoring

### [02_design.md](02_design.md)
Detailed technical design including:
- Complete architecture with component diagrams
- Core component specifications
- Data flow and protocol definitions
- Error handling and performance strategies
- Extension points for future growth

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Clean separation between API and implementation
- Multiple specialized Snakepit pools
- Protocol flexibility (JSON, MessagePack, Arrow)
- Pipeline orchestration for complex workflows

### [03_tasks.md](03_tasks.md)
Implementation roadmap with:
- Week-by-week task breakdown
- Clear dependencies and priorities
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Core infrastructure (project setup, signatures, Snakepit bridge)
- Week 2: Core functionality (router, templates, basic modules)
- Week 3: Advanced features (pipelines, sessions, protocols)
- Week 4: Production readiness (error handling, performance, documentation)

## Quick Start for Developers

1. **Read Requirements First**: Understand what we're building and why
2. **Review Design**: Familiarize yourself with the architecture
3. **Check Tasks**: Find your assigned tasks and dependencies
4. **Follow Patterns**: Use the established patterns from the design

## Key Concepts

### Implementation Strategy
- **Native First**: Implement in Elixir when it provides clear benefits
- **Python for Complexity**: Use Python/DSPy for complex ML operations
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically choose the best implementation
- **Pipeline Composition**: Mix native and Python seamlessly

### Technology Stack
- **Elixir 1.14+**: Core implementation language
- **Snakepit**: Python process management
- **DSPy 2.x**: Python ML framework
- **Jason**: JSON encoding/decoding
- **Telemetry**: Metrics and monitoring

### Architecture Principles
1. **Clean API**: Users shouldn't know implementation details
2. **Performance**: Native operations should be 10x faster
3. **Reliability**: Graceful degradation and recovery
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new implementations
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring built-in

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   mix compile
   mix test
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   iex -S mix
   ```

3. **Test Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   mix test
   mix credo
   mix dialyzer
   ```

4. **Benchmark Performance**:
   ```bash
   mix run bench/signatures.exs
   ```

## Success Criteria

The Foundation phase is successful when:
- All core DSPy modules are accessible from Elixir
- Native and Python implementations work seamlessly together
- Performance targets are met (sub-100ms for simple operations)
- Test coverage exceeds 90%
- Documentation is complete and examples work

## Next Steps

After completing the Foundation phase, we'll move to:
- **Phase 2**: Advanced features (variables, cognitive orchestration)
- **Phase 3**: Production features (distributed execution, auto-scaling)
- **Phase 4**: Enterprise features (multi-tenancy, advanced security)

## Questions?

- Technical questions: Review the design document
