# Stage 0 Implementation Completion Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures all components of Stage 0 (Protocol Foundation) are properly implemented and tested before proceeding to Stage 1.

## Pre-Implementation Verification
- [ ] Read all design documents:
  - [ ] `40_revised_stage0_protocol_foundation.md`
  - [ ] `01_unified_variables_specification.md`
  - [ ] Original bridge design documents
- [ ] Understand the unified architecture vision
- [ ] Review all implementation prompts (01-05)

## Protocol Definition (Prompt 01)
- [ ] Created `snakepit/priv/protos/bridge_service.proto`
- [ ] Defined BridgeService with all 8 RPC methods
- [ ] Implemented all message types:
  - [ ] Variable and related messages
  - [ ] Request/Response pairs for each RPC
  - [ ] Streaming messages (WatchVariablesRequest, VariableUpdate)
- [ ] Used protobuf Any with JSON encoding
- [ ] Added proper imports (google/protobuf/any.proto, timestamp.proto)
- [ ] Documented JSON encoding in comments
- [ ] Compiled successfully for both Python and Elixir

## Python Server (Prompt 02)
- [ ] Implemented SessionContext class:
  - [ ] Thread-safe variable storage
  - [ ] Observer pattern for watchers
  - [ ] Type validation
- [ ] Created TypeSerializer:
  - [ ] encode_any and decode_any methods
  - [ ] Support for all 8 types
  - [ ] Special value handling (NaN, Infinity)
- [ ] Implemented BridgeServicer:
  - [ ] All RPC methods implemented
  - [ ] WatchVariables streaming works
  - [ ] Proper error handling with gRPC status codes
- [ ] Server startup:
  - [ ] Prints "GRPC_READY:port" to stdout
  - [ ] Handles signals gracefully
  - [ ] Unbuffered output (PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1)
- [ ] Created VariableAwareMixin for DSPy integration

## Elixir Client (Prompt 03)
- [ ] Updated GRPCWorker:
  - [ ] Replaced TCP polling with stdout monitoring
  - [ ] Parses "GRPC_READY:port" correctly
  - [ ] Uses Erlang Port for process management
  - [ ] Handles partial lines properly
- [ ] Implemented GRPC.Client module:
  - [ ] All variable operations (register, get, set, list)
  - [ ] watch_variables returns stream
  - [ ] Proper error formatting
- [ ] Created StreamHandler:
  - [ ] Consumes gRPC streams
  - [ ] Handles different update types
  - [ ] Graceful error handling
- [ ] Updated application supervision tree

## Type Serialization (Prompt 04)
- [ ] Created Elixir type system:
  - [ ] Types behaviour defined
  - [ ] Module for each type (Float, Integer, String, Boolean, Choice, Module, Embedding, Tensor)
  - [ ] Validation and constraint checking
  - [ ] Serialize/deserialize implementations
- [ ] Created Python serialization:
  - [ ] TypeSerializer class
  - [ ] Matching logic with Elixir
  - [ ] NumPy support for embeddings/tensors
- [ ] Centralized serialization modules:
  - [ ] Elixir: Snakepit.Bridge.Serialization
  - [ ] Python: snakepit_bridge.serialization
- [ ] Cross-language compatibility verified

## Integration Tests (Prompt 05)
- [ ] Created test helper module
- [ ] Server startup tests:
  - [ ] Stdout detection works
  - [ ] Crash recovery tested
  - [ ] Concurrent startup handled
- [ ] Variable operation tests:
  - [ ] CRUD operations work
  - [ ] Constraints enforced
  - [ ] Session isolation verified
- [ ] Streaming tests:
  - [ ] Initial values received
  - [ ] Real-time updates work
  - [ ] Multiple watchers supported
  - [ ] Disconnection handled gracefully
- [ ] Complex type tests:
  - [ ] Embeddings with dimension constraints
  - [ ] Tensors with shape validation
  - [ ] Module type with choices
- [ ] Performance tests:
  - [ ] Latency < 5ms average
  - [ ] Throughput > 100 updates/second
- [ ] All tests pass consistently

## Additional Verification
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained:
  - [ ] Existing tool execution still works
  - [ ] No breaking changes to public APIs
- [ ] Telemetry/monitoring:
  - [ ] Events emitted at key points
  - [ ] Metrics available for debugging
- [ ] Documentation:
  - [ ] Protocol documented in proto file
  - [ ] README updated with new features
  - [ ] Example usage provided
- [ ] Error handling:
  - [ ] All error cases return proper gRPC status
  - [ ] No crashes on invalid input
  - [ ] Graceful degradation

## Performance Validation
- [ ] Memory usage stable over time
- [ ] No goroutine/process leaks
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable
- [ ] Network efficiency (no excessive polling)

## Security Review
- [ ] Input validation on all RPC methods
- [ ] No arbitrary code execution
- [ ] Session isolation enforced
- [ ] Resource limits in place

## Final Steps
- [ ] Run full test suite: `mix test --include integration`
- [ ] Run performance tests: `mix test --only performance`
- [ ] Review logs for any warnings/errors
- [ ] Test with real DSPy modules
- [ ] Create demo showing tool + variable integration

## Sign-off Criteria
Before proceeding to Stage 1:
- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Team review completed
- [ ] Deployment guide updated

## Notes Section
