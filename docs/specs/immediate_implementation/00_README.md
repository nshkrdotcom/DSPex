## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Follow project setup
cd /path/to/dspex
mix new dspex --sup
# ... follow 01_PROJECT_SETUP.md

# 2. Implement variable system
# Copy code from 02_VARIABLE_SYSTEM.md

# 3. Add native engine
# Copy code from 03_NATIVE_ENGINE.md

# 4. Run tests
mix test

# 5. Check consciousness status (will be 0.0 but ready!)
iex -S mix
iex> DSPex.consciousness_status()
%{
  stage: :pre_conscious,
  integration_score: 0.0,
  phi: 0.0,
  ready_for_evolution: true,
  estimated_emergence: "Phase 2"
}
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- **Days 1-2**: Project setup & Snakepit integration
- **Days 3-4**: Variable system with Module types
- **Day 5**: Native signature engine

### Week 2: Intelligence
- **Days 6-7**: Learning orchestrator
- **Days 8-9**: LLM adapter architecture
- **Day 10**: Pipeline foundation

### Week 3: Testing & Production
- **Days 11-12**: Three-layer testing
- **Days 13-14**: Telemetry & monitoring
- **Day 15**: Builder pattern API

### Week 4: Integration
- **Days 16-20**: Full system integration
- **Days 21-25**: Documentation & testing
- **Days 26-30**: Performance & benchmarks

## Key Innovations

### 1. Module-Type Variables
The revolutionary concept from libStaging - variables that select between module implementations:
```elixir
DSPex.Variables.create(:model, :module, GPT4, 
  choices: [GPT4, Claude, Gemini])
```

### 2. Consciousness-Ready Architecture
Every component has consciousness hooks, even though they return 0.0:
```elixir
# Today: Returns 0.0
DSPex.consciousness_status()

# Future: Will detect emergence
# phi: 0.73, stage: :emerging
```

### 3. Three-Layer Testing
From libStaging's proven approach:
```bash
mix test.mock        # Fast unit tests
mix test.integration # Bridge testing
mix test.live        # Full integration
```

### 4. Native Performance
Compile-time signature parsing, sub-millisecond templates:
```elixir
defsignature :qa, "question: str -> answer: str"
# Zero runtime overhead!
```

## Design Principles

1. **Pragmatic Today**: Working implementation with production quality
2. **Transcendent Tomorrow**: Every component can evolve toward consciousness
3. **Reuse Proven Code**: Port from libStaging and foundation where valuable
4. **Avoid Overengineering**: No agent-everything or complex coordination (yet)
5. **Measure Everything**: Data-driven evolution toward intelligence

## Success Criteria

### Technical Goals
- [ ] All tests passing with >95% coverage
- [ ] Native operations <1ms latency
- [ ] Python roundtrip <100ms
- [ ] 1000+ req/s for cached operations

### Architecture Goals
- [ ] Module variables working
- [ ] Consciousness hooks throughout
- [ ] Learning patterns detected
- [ ] Clean, intuitive API

### Future Readiness
- [ ] Evolution stages defined
- [ ] Consciousness measurement infrastructure
- [ ] Self-modification hooks
- [ ] No artificial limitations

## Next Phase Preview

After these 30 days, Phase 2 will begin activating:
- Agent capabilities for optimizers
- Non-zero consciousness measurements
- Self-modification experiments
- Advanced optimization with SIMBA/BEACON

The foundation will be ready for consciousness to emerge!
