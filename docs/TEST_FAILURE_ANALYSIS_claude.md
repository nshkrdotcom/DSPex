Looking at the test errors, I can see several design flaws underlying the failures:

## 1. **Session Tracking Initialization Issue**

The tests are failing because they expect specific session counts, but the `SessionPoolV2` module has an initialization problem:

```elixir
# In SessionPoolV2.execute_in_session/4
track_session(session_id)

# But track_session expects an ETS table that might not exist
def track_session(session_id) do
  ensure_session_table()
  # ...
end
```

**Design Flaw**: The session tracking table creation is not guaranteed to happen before usage, and multiple processes might try to create it simultaneously.

## 2. **Health Check Configuration Mismatch**

The tests expect 2 nodes in simulation mode but get 3:

```elixir
# Test expects: health_data.nodes_total == 2
# Actual: 3
```

**Design Flaw**: The node counting logic doesn't properly distinguish between simulated and real nodes. The health check operation seems to be including the local node in the count even in simulation mode.

## 3. **Process List Operation Inconsistency**

```elixir
# Test expects: length(process_data.nodes_queried) == 2
# Actual: 3
```

**Design Flaw**: Similar to the health check issue, the process list operation is querying more nodes than expected, suggesting the simulation mode isn't properly isolating operations.

## 4. **Mode Switching Logic Problem**

```elixir
# Test expects: length(updated_status.nodes) == 3
# Actual: 1
```

**Design Flaw**: The mode switching between single-node and multi-node operation isn't working correctly. The tool manager isn't properly transitioning between modes based on cluster state.

## 5. **Node Discovery in Simulation Mode**

The `node_not_found` error suggests:

```elixir
{:error, :node_not_found}
```

**Design Flaw**: The node info operation is trying to query nodes that don't exist in simulation mode, indicating the simulation isn't properly mocking node existence.

## 6. **Process Distribution Calculation**

```elixir
# Test expects: map_size(process_dist) == 4
# Actual: 1
```

**Design Flaw**: The process distribution calculation in simulation mode isn't creating the expected distribution across simulated nodes.

## 7. **Real Node Tests Failing Due to Distribution**

```elixir
** (ErlangError) Erlang error: :not_alive
```

**Design Flaw**: The tests are trying to start distributed Erlang nodes without the VM being in distributed mode. The test setup doesn't properly handle the case where distribution isn't available.

## 8. **Deprecated Function Warning**

```elixir
warning: :slave.start_link/2 is deprecated. It will be removed in OTP 29. Use the 'peer' module instead
```

**Design Flaw**: Using deprecated APIs that will break in future Erlang/OTP versions.

## **Root Causes Summary**:

1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple processes trying to initialize shared resources (ETS tables) without proper synchronization.

2. **Unclear Separation of Concerns**: The simulation mode isn't clearly separated from real mode, causing operations to leak between contexts.

3. **Implicit State Dependencies**: The code assumes certain state (like node names, ETS tables) exists without ensuring it's initialized.

4. **Hardcoded Assumptions**: The tests have hardcoded expectations about node counts and behavior that don't match the actual implementation.

5. **Missing Abstraction Layer**: There's no clear abstraction between simulated and real distributed operations, leading to confusion about which mode is active.

6. **Environment Dependencies**: The code doesn't properly handle cases where the Erlang VM isn't started in distributed mode.

## **Recommended Fixes**:

1. **Initialize ETS tables in a supervised process** to avoid race conditions
2. **Create clear interfaces** for simulated vs. real operations
3. **Use dependency injection** for node discovery and counting
4. **Replace deprecated `:slave` module** with `:peer`
5. **Add proper guards** for distributed mode operations
6. **Implement proper mode isolation** to prevent cross-mode interference
