# gRPC Bridge Status Report

## Summary
We've examined the SnakepitGRPCBridge implementation and identified the key components needed to get basic gRPC communication working between Snakepit and Python processes.

## Current Status

### 1. Architecture Understanding ✓
- **Snakepit**: Pure infrastructure layer providing process management
- **SnakepitGRPCBridge**: ML platform layer that bridges Elixir and Python
- **Adapter Pattern**: `SnakepitGRPCBridge.Adapter` implements `Snakepit.Adapter` behavior

### 2. Key Components Identified ✓

#### Elixir Side:
- `SnakepitGRPCBridge.Adapter` - Implements Snakepit.Adapter behavior
- `SnakepitGRPCBridge.Python.Process` - Manages Python subprocess via Port
- `SnakepitGRPCBridge.GRPC.SimpleClient` - Handles gRPC communication
- Proto definitions in `lib/snakepit_grpc_bridge/grpc/generated/`

#### Python Side:
- `priv/python/grpc_server.py` - Main gRPC server
- `priv/python/test_adapter.py` - Simple test adapter
- Proto definitions generated from `priv/proto/snakepit_bridge.proto`

### 3. Working Demo Created ✓
Created `examples/basic_bridge_demo.ex` that demonstrates:
- How adapters implement the Snakepit.Adapter behavior
- Basic command execution pattern
- Error handling
- Worker lifecycle management

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Compilation Issues
The bridge project has several compilation errors that need fixing:
- Missing or incorrect proto module references
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Missing functions in some modules

### 2. Create Minimal Working gRPC Integration
1. Generate correct protobuf files for both Elixir and Python
2. Create a minimal Python gRPC server that actually works
3. Update the SimpleClient to properly communicate with Python
4. Test basic command execution through the full stack

### 3. Integration Path
```
Snakepit.execute/3
    ↓
SnakepitGRPCBridge.Adapter.execute/3
    ↓
SnakepitGRPCBridge.Python.Process (GenServer)
    ↓
gRPC call to Python
    ↓
Python adapter executes command
    ↓
Result returned via gRPC
```

## Key Insights

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The adapter pattern cleanly separates infrastructure (Snakepit) from platform (Bridge)
2. **Process Management**: Python processes are managed via Elixir Ports with gRPC for communication
3. **Session Context**: Python adapters get a SessionContext for accessing Elixir-side state
4. **Bidirectional Communication**: Python can call back to Elixir for variables and tools

## Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Get a basic echo command working through the full stack before adding complexity
2. **Fix Proto Generation**: Ensure protobuf files are correctly generated and match on both sides
3. **Isolate Components**: Test each component (Port management, gRPC, adapters) independently
4. **Use Mock Adapters**: For testing Snakepit integration, use mock adapters that don't require Python

## Files Created
- `/snakepit/test/snakepit/adapter_contract_test.exs` - Adapter behavior tests
- `/snakepit/test/snakepit/process_management_test.exs` - Process management tests
- `/snakepit/examples/01-04_*.exs` - Example adapter implementations
- `/snakepit_grpc_bridge/priv/python/test_adapter.py` - Simple Python test adapter
- `/snakepit_grpc_bridge/examples/basic_bridge_demo.ex` - Working demo of adapter pattern

The foundation is solid, but the bridge project needs some cleanup to get basic gRPC working. Once that's done, integrating with Snakepit should be straightforward using the adapter pattern.
