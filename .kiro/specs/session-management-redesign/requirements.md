# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DSPex V2 pool implementation contains fundamental architectural flaws in its session management system that cause intermittent failures, performance degradation, and scalability limitations. This feature will implement a complete redesign of the session management architecture to address these critical issues by replacing the current worker-local session storage with a centralized session store that enables true stateless workers and horizontal scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want a centralized session store that decouples session state from worker instances, so that sessions can be accessed by any worker and the system can scale horizontally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL store session data in a centralized ETS-based store accessible by all workers
2. WHEN a worker needs to access session data THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from the centralized store rather than local worker storage
3. WHEN multiple workers attempt to access the same session THEN the system SHALL provide consistent session data across all workers
4. WHEN a worker fails or restarts THEN the system SHALL maintain session data availability through the centralized store

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want stateless workers that fetch session state on demand, so that any worker can handle any session request without session affinity constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker is initialized THEN the system SHALL NOT store any session-specific data locally in the worker
2. WHEN a worker needs to execute a session-based command THEN the system SHALL fetch the required session data from the centralized store
3. WHEN a worker completes a session operation THEN the system SHALL update the session data in the centralized store
4. WHEN load balancing occurs THEN the system SHALL route requests to any available worker regardless of previous session bindings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want automatic session lifecycle management with TTL-based expiration, so that stale sessions are cleaned up automatically without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL assign a configurable TTL (default 1 hour)
2. WHEN a session is accessed THEN the system SHALL update the last_accessed timestamp
3. WHEN the cleanup process runs THEN the system SHALL remove sessions that have exceeded their TTL
4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup action and free associated resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want session migration capabilities for load balancing and maintenance, so that sessions can be redistributed across workers dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session migration is requested THEN the system SHALL transfer session state between workers without data loss
2. WHEN a worker needs maintenance THEN the system SHALL evacuate all sessions from that worker to other available workers
3. WHEN load rebalancing is triggered THEN the system SHALL redistribute sessions according to the target distribution
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous state and log the failure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want improved anonymous session handling with temporary sessions, so that anonymous operations don't cause routing failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous operation is requested THEN the system SHALL create a temporary session with a short TTL (default 5 minutes)
2. WHEN the anonymous operation completes THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up the temporary session
3. WHEN anonymous session creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message
4. WHEN multiple anonymous operations occur THEN the system SHALL create separate temporary sessions for each operation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that session-related failures are handled gracefully with appropriate fallback strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session store operation fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation with exponential backoff
2. WHEN session data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect the corruption and attempt recovery or cleanup
3. WHEN the session store becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide degraded functionality with local caching
4. WHEN recovery operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and alert administrators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want backward compatibility during the migration process, so that existing functionality continues to work while the new system is being deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL support both old and new session management systems simultaneously
2. WHEN client APIs are called THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interface and behavior as the current implementation
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL allow switching between old and new systems via configuration
4. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL restore the previous session management system without data loss

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DSPex developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and metrics for session operations, so that I can track system performance and identify issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session operations occur THEN the system SHALL record metrics for creation, access, update, and deletion operations
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and log warnings
3. WHEN system health is queried THEN the system SHALL provide detailed statistics about session store performance
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of session operations and state changes
