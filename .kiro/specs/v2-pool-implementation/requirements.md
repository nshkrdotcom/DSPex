# V2 Pool Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

The V2 Pool Implementation is a comprehensive overhaul of the DSPex Python bridge pooling system to address critical architectural issues, test failures, and production readiness concerns. This implementation will transform the current blocking GenServer bottleneck into a robust, concurrent, production-ready pooling system with proper error handling, health monitoring, and observability.

The current system has achieved 99% test pass rate (495/500 tests passing) with solid infrastructure components, but requires systematic fixes to achieve 100% reliability and production readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Immediate Stability Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer using DSPex, I want all pool-related tests to pass consistently so that I can rely on the system's stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NimblePool callbacks are executed THEN the system SHALL return only valid NimblePool tuples (never `{:error, reason}`)
2. WHEN port connections are attempted THEN the system SHALL validate port state using `Port.info()` before `Port.connect()`
3. WHEN test assertions check response data THEN the system SHALL handle both map and list response formats correctly
4. WHEN tests run in different environments THEN the system SHALL skip gracefully with clear messages when environment requirements are not met
5. WHEN service detection is performed THEN the system SHALL use `Process.whereis` as primary method with Registry as fallback

### Requirement 2: Worker Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want workers to have proper lifecycle management with health monitoring so that failed workers are detected and recovered automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker is created THEN the system SHALL initialize it with a formal state machine (:initializing → :ready → :busy → :degraded → :terminating → :terminated)
2. WHEN a worker is in operation THEN the system SHALL perform health checks every 30 seconds
3. WHEN a worker fails health checks THEN the system SHALL degrade the worker after 1 failure and remove it after 3 consecutive failures
4. WHEN a worker transitions states THEN the system SHALL log the transition with duration and reason
5. WHEN session affinity is required THEN the system SHALL maintain session-to-worker bindings for 5 minutes

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling with automatic recovery so that transient failures don't cause system outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL wrap them with ErrorHandler context including retry metadata
2. WHEN recoverable errors happen THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry with maximum 3 attempts
3. WHEN cascading failures are detected THEN the system SHALL activate circuit breaker pattern to prevent system overload
4. WHEN worker failures occur THEN the system SHALL determine recovery strategy (retry/degrade/remove/replace) based on failure type
5. WHEN error telemetry is needed THEN the system SHALL emit telemetry events for all error scenarios

### Requirement 4: Test Infrastructure Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable test execution with proper isolation so that tests can run consistently in CI/CD environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN each test SHALL get its own isolated supervision tree
2. WHEN pool tests run THEN the system SHALL use eager initialization instead of lazy loading
3. WHEN test environments differ THEN the system SHALL validate environment configuration and skip appropriately
4. WHEN concurrent tests execute THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions with deterministic startup sequences
5. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure proper resource cleanup without affecting other tests

### Requirement 5: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and performance optimization so that I can maintain production SLA requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL achieve <100ms p99 latency for pool operations
2. WHEN worker metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL track state transitions, health checks, and session affinity hits/misses
3. WHEN pool utilization is monitored THEN the system SHALL maintain 60-80% utilization under normal load
4. WHEN performance bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL provide telemetry data for identification and resolution
5. WHEN production deployment happens THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments with graceful worker replacement

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing DSPex user, I want the V2 pool to maintain API compatibility so that my existing code continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing adapter interfaces are called THEN the system SHALL maintain the same function signatures and return formats
2. WHEN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL support both pooled and single-bridge modes
3. WHEN error formats are returned THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatible error structures
4. WHEN migration occurs THEN the system SHALL provide feature flags for gradual rollout
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL support reverting to V1 implementation without data loss

### Requirement 7: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want production-ready features like graceful shutdown, resource management, and operational visibility so that the system can be deployed safely in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system shutdown is initiated THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate all workers with 30-second timeout
2. WHEN resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement bounded pools with overflow handling
3. WHEN operational visibility is needed THEN the system SHALL expose health metrics, worker states, and pool utilization
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support dynamic worker scaling within min/max bounds
5. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide worker replacement and emergency fallback mechanisms

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Port Communication Failures**: Implement message framing protocol with emergency worker creation fallback
- **Python Process Crashes**: Process monitoring with auto-restart and circuit breaker activation
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Bounded pool with overflow and request queuing with timeout

### Operational Risks  
- **Performance Regression**: Comprehensive benchmarking with feature flags for rollback
- **Migration Complexity**: Parallel run capability with staged rollout plan
