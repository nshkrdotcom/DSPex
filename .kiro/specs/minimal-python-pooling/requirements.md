# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a streamlined, pragmatic approach to Python process pooling using DSPex. The focus is on creating a "Minimum Viable Pool" that provides reliable, stateless pooling of long-running Python processes without the complexity of advanced enterprise features like session migration, complex error orchestration, or stateful affinity. The primary goal is to optimize for the execution time bottleneck of Python tasks while maintaining simplicity and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute Python programs through a simple pool interface, so that I can leverage concurrent Python processes without managing complex pooling logic myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the pool API with a program and inputs THEN the system SHALL execute the program in an available Python worker process
2. WHEN no workers are available THEN the system SHALL queue the request until a worker becomes available or timeout occurs
3. WHEN a worker completes execution THEN the system SHALL return the worker to the pool for reuse
4. IF the execution exceeds the configured timeout THEN the system SHALL return a timeout error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure pool size and behavior, so that I can optimize resource usage for my specific workload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure pool_size THEN the system SHALL maintain exactly that number of Python worker processes
2. WHEN I configure overflow THEN the system SHALL allow up to that many additional temporary workers under load
3. WHEN I configure checkout_timeout THEN the system SHALL wait that duration before timing out checkout requests
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize all configured workers and verify they are responsive by sending an initial 'ping' command and receiving a successful response from each worker

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable error handling and recovery, so that temporary failures don't break the entire pool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python worker process crashes (i.e., its OS process exits) THEN the pool's supervisor SHALL restart that worker automatically to maintain the configured pool_size
2. WHEN a client's command to a worker exceeds the operation timeout THEN that worker SHALL be considered unresponsive, terminated, and automatically replaced by the pool
3. WHEN communication with a worker fails for a non-timeout reason (e.g., port closed during operation) THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error to the client, and the faulty worker SHALL be terminated and replaced
4. WHEN the PoolSupervisor itself crashes THEN the Application's top-level supervisor SHALL restart it, which in turn restarts the entire pool with fresh workers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use session identifiers for logical grouping, so that I can track and organize requests without requiring stateful affinity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a session_id with a request THEN the system SHALL include it in logs and telemetry
2. WHEN I provide a session_id THEN the system SHALL NOT enforce worker affinity based on that ID
3. WHEN I omit a session_id THEN the system SHALL still process the request normally
4. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL include session_id for request traceability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a focused test suite for core functionality, so that I can verify the essential pooling behavior without running unnecessary tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run tagged core tests THEN the system SHALL execute only tests for essential pooling modules
2. WHEN core tests pass THEN I SHALL have confidence that basic pooling functionality works correctly
3. WHEN I add new core functionality THEN I SHALL be able to tag new tests appropriately
4. IF core tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which essential functionality is broken

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want direct port communication between client and worker, so that I can achieve optimal performance without message passing overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker is checked out THEN the client process SHALL receive direct access to the worker's port
2. WHEN the client sends commands THEN they SHALL go directly to the Python process without intermediary processes
3. WHEN the Python process responds THEN the response SHALL come directly back to the client process
4. WHEN communication completes THEN the worker SHALL be checked back into the pool immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ignore complex enterprise features, so that I can focus on simple, reliable pooling without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the pool THEN the system SHALL NOT include session state management
2. WHEN implementing the pool THEN the system SHALL NOT include session migration capabilities  
3. WHEN implementing the pool THEN the system SHALL NOT include complex error orchestration beyond basic supervision
4. WHEN implementing the pool THEN the system SHALL use the simple PoolWorkerV2 instead of enhanced variants
