# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive cluster visualization system for DSPex that displays all nodes, supervision trees, and processes in an interactive web-based interface. The visualization provides a real-time, hierarchical view of the entire cluster topology, enabling developers and operators to monitor and understand the distributed system architecture at a glance.

The system will integrate with the existing DSPex supervision architecture and provide a clean, terminal-style interface consistent with the project's aesthetic. The visualization focuses on core functionality with a simple implementation that can be extended with advanced features later.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with DSPex clusters, I want to see a visual representation of all nodes in my cluster, so that I can understand the overall system topology and identify which nodes are active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the cluster visualization page THEN the system SHALL display all connected nodes in the cluster horizontally across the screen
2. WHEN a node is alive and responsive THEN the system SHALL display it with a green status indicator
3. WHEN a node is unreachable or dead THEN the system SHALL display it with a red status indicator
4. WHEN I hover over a node THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with node details including name, status, memory usage, and process count

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see the supervision tree structure for each node, so that I can understand how processes are organized and supervised within each node.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualization loads THEN the system SHALL display each node's supervision tree growing vertically downward from the node
2. WHEN displaying supervision trees THEN the system SHALL show supervisors as larger blue circles and workers as smaller green circles
3. WHEN a process is dead or crashed THEN the system SHALL display it with a red color
4. WHEN I click on a supervisor THEN the system SHALL expand or collapse its children processes
5. WHEN displaying the tree THEN the system SHALL use lines with arrows to show parent-child relationships between processes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging distributed systems, I want to see detailed information about individual processes, so that I can identify performance issues and understand process behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over any process in the visualization THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip with process details including PID, type, memory usage, and message queue length
2. WHEN I click on any process THEN the system SHALL open a details panel showing comprehensive process information
3. WHEN displaying process information THEN the system SHALL include memory usage, CPU usage, message queue length, and uptime where available
4. WHEN a process has high memory usage or long message queues THEN the system SHALL visually indicate this through color coding or size

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations engineer monitoring production systems, I want the visualization to update automatically, so that I can see real-time changes in the cluster topology without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualization is active THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh cluster data every 5 seconds
2. WHEN cluster topology changes occur THEN the system SHALL update the visualization smoothly without full page reload
3. WHEN new processes are created or destroyed THEN the system SHALL animate the changes to make them visible
4. WHEN I toggle auto-refresh off THEN the system SHALL stop automatic updates until manually refreshed or re-enabled

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user working with large cluster topologies, I want interactive controls for the visualization, so that I can navigate and explore complex supervision trees effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualization loads THEN the system SHALL provide zoom and pan capabilities for navigating large topologies
2. WHEN I use the mouse wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom in and out of the visualization
3. WHEN I drag on empty space THEN the system SHALL pan the visualization to show different areas
4. WHEN I have a large supervision tree THEN the system SHALL limit the default depth to 5 levels to maintain performance
5. WHEN I want to see deeper levels THEN the system SHALL provide expand controls to load children on demand

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with existing DSPex infrastructure, I want the visualization to work seamlessly with the current architecture, so that it doesn't interfere with existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualization system starts THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing DSPex.Application supervision tree
2. WHEN collecting cluster data THEN the system SHALL use existing Elixir distributed computing capabilities without requiring external dependencies
3. WHEN the web interface is not accessed THEN the system SHALL have minimal performance impact on the core DSPex functionality
4. WHEN errors occur in the visualization system THEN they SHALL NOT affect the core DSPex Python bridge or signature processing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user accessing the cluster visualization, I want a clean and intuitive web interface, so that I can easily understand and interact with the cluster topology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the visualization page THEN the system SHALL display a terminal-style interface consistent with DSPex aesthetics
2. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear controls for view mode selection (tree layout, force layout, hierarchical)
3. WHEN the system is loading data THEN it SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
5. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and work on different screen sizes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working with the DSPex codebase, I want the visualization system to be testable and maintainable, so that it can be reliably developed and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the backend API THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive unit tests for all data collection functions
2. WHEN implementing the frontend visualization THEN the system SHALL include JavaScript tests for rendering and interaction logic
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL log appropriate error messages for debugging
4. WHEN extending the system THEN the code SHALL be modular and follow existing DSPex patterns and conventions
