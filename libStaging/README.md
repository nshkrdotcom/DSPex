# libStaging Directory

This directory contains a copy of the elixir_ml lib directory, imported on July 18, 2025.

## Contents

- **dspex/** - Original DSPex implementation from elixir_ml
- **elixir_ml/** - ElixirML modules and implementations
- **mix/** - Mix tasks and utilities

## Purpose

This staging area allows us to:
1. Review existing elixir_ml implementations
2. Identify components that can be integrated with DSPex V2
3. Gradually migrate and adapt useful modules
4. Maintain reference to original implementations

## Next Steps

1. Analyze existing DSPex modules for integration opportunities
2. Identify which elixir_ml components align with DSPex V2 architecture
3. Adapt and integrate selected modules using Sinter for schema definitions
4. Leverage existing work while maintaining new architecture principles

## Notes

- This is a staging area only - do not run or compile directly
- Use as reference for migration and integration
